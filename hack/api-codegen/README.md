# api-codegen

![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-31.3%25-yellow)

Build-time code generators for the ROSA Hyperfleet API. These tools scan Go types with markers and generate passthrough types, OpenAPI schemas, CRD variants, conversion functions, and field validation metadata.

## Design

This tooling follows the same patterns as the GCP HCP **gecko/orlop** codegen:

- **JSON roundtrip conversions** — `conversion-gen` uses `json.Marshal` / `json.Unmarshal` to project CRD types into REST types (and back), rather than hand-writing per-field assignment code. Hidden fields drop automatically because REST types omit them. Service-set fields are enriched via a JSON overlay on unproject.
- **Controller-tools for OpenAPI** — `openapi-gen` delegates to `sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools` (`crd.Parser` + `loader.LoadRoots()`) to produce OpenAPI v3 schemas from CRD types, replacing hand-built Swagger 2.0 output.
- **`text/template` for code generation** — all generated Go source is produced through `text/template`, not `fmt.Sprintf` / `strings.Builder`. This makes the output shape readable and auditable in the template itself.
- **Dynamic type discovery** — resource types, imports, and field metadata are derived from the Go AST and the field registry at generation time. No hard-coded type lists that silently break when CRD types are added or removed.

## Generators

| Command                | Purpose                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `passthrough-gen`      | Generate passthrough struct types from HyperShift API types     |
| `marker-scanner`       | Extract `+hyperfleet:` marker metadata from Go types            |
| `openapi-gen`          | Generate OpenAPI v3 schemas via controller-tools CRD extraction |
| `conversion-gen`       | Generate JSON-roundtrip conversion functions (CRD ↔ REST)       |
| `crd-variants`         | Produce CRD variants filtered by feature gates                  |
| `featuregate-info`     | Emit feature gate metadata for CRD fields                       |
| `verify-configuration` | Validate marker consistency across types                        |

## Usage

```bash
make build-api-codegen     # Build all 7 generator binaries
make test-api-codegen      # Run tests
make test-unit COVERAGE=1  # Generate unit-test coverage profiles
make test-unit COVERAGE=html  # Generate profiles and HTML reports
```

## Makefile codegen pipeline

The top-level Makefile exposes the following targets for running the codegen pipeline:

| Target                | Description                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `codegen-passthrough` | Generate passthrough types from HyperShift into `api/v1alpha1/` |
| `codegen-registry`    | Generate field metadata registry from `+hyperfleet:` markers    |
| `codegen-conversion`  | Generate REST types and Project/Unproject conversion functions  |
| `codegen-verify`      | Verify codegen outputs compile (`api` + `platform-api`)         |
| `codegen`             | Run full pipeline: passthrough + registry + verify              |
| `verify-codegen`      | Fail if codegen outputs are out of date (git diff check)        |
| `verify-conversion`   | Fail if conversion outputs are out of date                      |

### Dependency chain

```
codegen
  └─ codegen-verify
       └─ codegen-registry
            ├─ generate          (controller-gen deepcopy on api/...)
            └─ build-api-codegen (builds marker-scanner + conversion-gen + other tools)
                 └─ marker-scanner scans api/v1alpha1 → hack/api-codegen/pkg/registry/field_metadata.go

codegen-conversion
  └─ codegen-registry  (needs field metadata to determine hidden/visible fields)
  └─ build-api-codegen (builds conversion-gen)
       └─ conversion-gen outputs:
            api/v1alpha1/public/         (REST types, visible fields only, package "public")
            platform-api/pkg/conversion/
            ├─ types.go                  (ServiceSetFields)
            └─ v1alpha1/
                ├─ cluster.go            (ProjectCluster, UnprojectCluster)
                └─ nodepool.go           (ProjectNodePool, UnprojectNodePool)
```

`codegen-passthrough` is intentionally **not** in the `codegen` chain yet — it needs to be run manually since `passthrough-gen` rewrites `api/v1alpha1/` files that are currently hand-curated (`hostedclusterspec.passthrough.go`). Once the passthrough codegen is fully wired in a future PR, it can be chained in.

### Migration notes (from ROSAENG-61802 branch)

The codegen targets were originally developed on the `ROSAENG-61802-field-validation-v2` branch targeting `api/public/v2alpha1/`. They were ported and refactored for the current type layout:

- **Paths**: `api/public/v2alpha1/` → `api/v1alpha1/`
- **Package**: `v2alpha1` → `v1alpha1`
- **No `generate-public-deepcopy`**: Eliminated — the existing `generate` target already runs controller-gen on `api/...` which covers `v1alpha1`
- **`codegen-registry`** depends on `generate` instead of `generate-public-deepcopy`
- **`verify-codegen`** diffs `api/v1alpha1/` instead of `api/public/v2alpha1/`
